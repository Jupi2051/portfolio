# This is my portfolio!

Hi! I'm Jupi and i was originally working on this project for fun and to pass time as a side project, but then realized it had really good potential of displaying skill and past projects i have worked on and then it hit me that i could make this my portfolio and i think it's a unique idea since i haven't seen anyone else do it this way.

# About
The entire project is based on the UI of Windows the point of this is to give whoever browsing my portfolio the feeling that they are reading on my personal computer with every detail stored inside an application and i realized it also provides an easy way to compare between every project i've made side by side and focusing instead of having them thrown in multiple places and pictures!

##  Starting

The project was written with React and Redux with vite as a local development environment.

*install the dependencies first by running:*
`npm i`

To start the project in dev mode run 
`npm run dev`

To build run
`npm run build`
